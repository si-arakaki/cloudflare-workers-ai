src/router/ directory stores files for routing.

each route path should separated into sub directories. like:

| url | directory for route handler |
| :-- | :-- |
| http://localhost:8787/ | src/router/home/ |
| http://localhost:8787/chat | src/router/chat/ |
| http://localhost:8787/inpaint | src/router/inpaint/ |
